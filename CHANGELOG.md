# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5] - 2018-01-17
### Added
- Markdown links to version tags on release headings.
- Unreleased section to gather unreleased changes and encourage note
keeping prior to releases.

## [0.4] - 2018-02-06
### Added
- Better explanation of the difference between the file ("CHANGELOG")
and its function "the change log".

### Changed
- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site
to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file â€” the
logging of changes.

### Removed
- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no
notable changes.

## [0.3] - 2018-02-01
### Added
- "Why should I care?" section mentioning The Changelog podcast.

## [0.2] - 2018-01-6
### Added
- Explanation of the recommended reverse chronological release ordering.

## 0.1 - 2017-12-25
### Added
- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a
  standardized open source project CHANGELOG.
- CNAME file to enable GitHub Pages custom domain
- README now contains answers to common questions about CHANGELOGs
- Good examples and basic guidelines, including proper date formatting.
- Counter-examples: "What makes unicorns cry?"
